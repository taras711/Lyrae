*/

/**
* ShadowEvaluatorMirror.js
*
* Implements a mirroring mechanism for shadow DOM evaluation.
* Maintains a synchronized view of the shadow DOM tree for efficient comparison,
* state tracking, and updates. Facilitates debugging and testing by providing a mirrored view of changes to the shadow DOM.
*/

/**
* shadowReactor.js
*
* Acts as a reactive engine for shadow DOM updates.
* Watches for changes within shadow roots and triggers appropriate reactions or updates.
* Integrates with the app's reactive system to keep the shadow DOM in sync
