    Comments are used to insert notes into the code, which the parser ignores. 
    They can be: 
        - Block comments 
        - Starting and ending with the !!! marker on a separate line. 
        - Everything between these markers is ignored. 
    - Syntax: 
        !!! This is a note for the entire block. It can have multiple lines. !!! 
        - Line comments (from the beginning of the line) 
            - !!! at the beginning of the line to its end. 
            - Suitable for short notes for the entire line of code. 
    - Syntax:
        !!! This condition is temporarily disabled 
        if something then 
            log "..." 
        end
    - Inline comments- 
    !!! in the middle of the line â†’ from this marker to the end of the line is a comment.
    - It is used for notes behind the code without disrupting its execution.
    - Syntax:
        case _ -> "Out of monitored range" !!! This branch is triggered rarely 
        score = 55 !!! Value after calculation
- We do not write comments inside quotes/backticks: Anything inside "..." or `...` is a string, not a comment. 
- Nesting comments is not supported - a block !!! cannot be started inside another block !!!
